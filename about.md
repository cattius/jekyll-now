Hi, I'm Cat. I'm currently a PhD student at Graz University of Technology, researching microarchitectural security (and obsessing over CPUs) in the [Core Security group](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/research-area/securesystems/) at the Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communications.

Previously I completed my MEng Computer Science at the University of Bristol, and interned on the Privacy and Civil Liberties team at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/) and at [SCISYS](https://www.scisys.com/). 

When I'm not working on tech, you'll likely find me in the mountains. You can check out some of my adventures [here](/ubes-uk).
