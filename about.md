Hi, I'm Catherine. I write code, investigate low-level system behaviour, ponder what makes a system intelligent, and climb the odd mountain or two.

I'm a final-year MEng Computer Science student at the University of Bristol in the UK. I spent 2017-18 studying abroad at TU Graz in Austria, where I first dived into cybersecurity and carried out a research project into undocumented CPU behaviour. My research interests span cybersecurity, neuroscience, deep learning, and AGI (artificial general intelligence).

I'm particularly fascinated by how these areas interact. There's a deep symbiosis between neuroscience and deep learning, and as we progress towards developing AGI ensuring it is secure and resistant to adversarial input will become paramount. Researchers have already carried out side-channel attacks on the brain, and an unprotected digital AGI would be far more accessible to attackers than a silly human which needs an EEG attached to it first. But I also believe that neuroscience, deep learning and AGI connect on a much more fundamental level: **computation is about more than just circuits and digital computers**. The behaviour of any complex system can be interpreted as 'computation' - even a puddle of water! I believe that if we ever do find the 'secret' to intelligence it'll be something shared by all complex systems (see Stephen Wolfram's [principle of computational equivalence](http://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/) for more on this).

Our good old circuit-based digital computers are also full of secrets. Once you get down to the low-level software and hardware implementation details there's a lot of "unexpected" behaviour (unexpected by other developers...or sometimes even by the original developers/engineers!), and this almost always leads to security vulnerabilities - from Rowhammer, Meltdown and the Spectre class of vulnerabilities to the shadowy unknown workings of Intel ME / AMD PSP and undocumented CPU instructions and MSRs. I'm especially interested in undocumented CPU behaviour, and in side channels and information leakage.

Outside of tech I love spending time in the mountains to hike, camp, and ski, and this passion has taken me to mountain ranges around the world. I particularly enjoy the freedom of long-distance hiking (backpacking) - and have worn out a ridiculous number of pairs of shoes doing this! The [University of Bristol Expeditions Society](https://www.ubes.co.uk/) (UBES) has been my second family for the last four years, and as Development Officer for UBES I'm developing and teaching a training curriculum in expedition planning and leadership, alongside arranging talks from outside speakers, helping to organise weekend trips for 30-50 students, and teaching rock climbing to beginners. You can read more about UBES and my hiking adventures [here](/adventures).
