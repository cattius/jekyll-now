Hi, I'm Catherine. I'm currently a PhD student at Graz University of Technology, researching microarchitectural security (and obsessing over CPUs!) in the [Core Security group](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/research-area/securesystems/) at the Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communications.
