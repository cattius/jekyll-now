Hi, I'm Cat. I'm currently a PhD student at Graz University of Technology, researching microarchitectural security (and obsessing over CPUs) in the [Core Security group](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/research-area/securesystems/) at the Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communications.

I'm particularly interested in ISA design and instruction decoding, the 'conflict' between energy efficiency and security, and whether we can rearchitect the CPU and the memory subsystem to reduce this conflict.

Previously I completed my MEng Computer Science at the University of Bristol, and interned on the Privacy and Civil Liberties team at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/) and at [SCISYS](https://www.scisys.com/). 

When I'm not working on tech, you'll likely find me in the mountains. You can check out some of my adventures [here](/adventures).
