Hi, I'm Cat.

Currently @ [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/); previously microarchitectural security @ [IAIK](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/research-area/securesystems/), privacy and civil liberties engineering @ [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/), MEng Computer Science @ [Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/departments/computerscience/).

When I'm not working on tech, you'll likely find me in the mountains. You can check out some of my adventures [here](/adventures).
