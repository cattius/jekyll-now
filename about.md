Hi, I'm Catherine. I develop software, investigate low-level system behaviour, ponder questions like "how does the brain work?" and "what makes a system intelligent?", and climb the odd mountain or two.

I'm a final-year MEng Computer Science student at the University of Bristol in the UK. I spent 2017-18 studying at TU Graz in Austria, where I first dived into cybersecurity and carried out a research project into undocumented CPU behaviour. My [research interests](/research) are **cybersecurity, neuroscience, deep learning, and AGI (artificial general intelligence)** and I'll be blogging about these topics - and how they interact with one another - here on this website. This website is currently under construction, so bear with me for a while!

Outside of tech I love spending time in the mountains to hike, camp, and ski, and this passion has taken me to mountain ranges around the world. I particularly enjoy the freedom of long-distance hiking - and have worn out a ridiculous number of pairs of shoes doing this! The [University of Bristol Expeditions Society](https://www.ubes.co.uk/) (UBES) has been my second family for the last four years, and as Development Officer for UBES I'm developing and teaching a training curriculum in expedition planning and leadership, alongside arranging talks from outside speakers, helping to organise weekend trips for 30-50 students, and teaching rock climbing to beginners. You can read more about my hiking adventures and the training curriculum [here](/adventures).
