# Other Adventures
I've also been on lots of weekend hiking and climbing trips with UBES. I don't tend to blog on here about these trips, but I've written a few posts for the UBES blog. Our blog is very informal and full of in-jokes, but tries to showcase the adventures the UK has to offer (and I tried to do the same for Austria while I was away as UBES Foreign Correspondent!). The Welsh 3000s is a particularly fun challenge: 15 summits, 3 fabulous mountain ranges, 48km (car-to-car) of hiking and over 4000m ascent in under 24hrs - I can't recommend it enough.
