In June-July 2016 I took part in a UBES summer trip led by Adam to the Lofoten Islands in Norway. The islands are without a doubt the most spectacular area I've ever been to.

Trip highlights:
* The midnight sun (the islands are in the Arctic Circle)
* The astounding view from Reinebringen
* Horseidvika beach (it looks like the Caribbean with added Nordic mountains - until you jump into the sea!)
* Endless vistas of mountains rising straight up out of the sea
* [Allemannsrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam#Norway)

The only slight mishap was a few of us getting stuck in Bodø for 3 days waiting for our lost luggage...There's a lovely national park nearby, but it's not a cheap city to be stuck in on a student budget! We covered 70km on Moskenesøya with the rest of the team (once we had our bags back) hiking from Ramberg to Å via Kvalvika beach, Horseidvika beach, Reinebringen, and Munken. We also hiked ~40km on our own exploring around Bodø. The next plan is to come back for bikepacking!
