During my MEng (2015-2019) the University of Bristol Expeditions Society (UBES) were my second family. At every opportunity we'd disappear off to the mountains: Snowdonia, the Lake District, the Brecon Beacons, Portland and the Peak District for climbing, Lochaber at New Year, and even once (as storms kept us from the mountains!) to the Cornish coast. 

I spent two years on the committee as Expeditions Officer (2016-17) and Development Officer (2018-19), co-organising weekend trips and the 2016 Scotland trip, teaching climbing and expedition skills, and organising the 2017 expedition to Georgia. Plus a year as Foreign Correspondent in Austria, where my only duties were to bag summits for UBES and advertise by wearing UBESwear as often as possible :') Now I'm back in Austria, my campaign continues to convince non-Brits that the UK *does* have decent mountains!

UBES is [turning 60](https://checkout.matterpay.com/s/ubes/ZXZlbnQ6Njgz/ubes-60th-anniversary) this year! You can read more about the society's origins in the University of Bristol Trans-Continental Expedition 1960-61 [here](http://www.nonesuchexpeditions.com/bristol-expedition/contents.htm).
