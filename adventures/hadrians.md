The Hadrian's Wall Path is an 135km trail in the north of England from Bowness-on-Solway to Wallsend. The original wall is now mostly destroyed, but there's plenty to see along the trail: there's some original remains of the wall and the Roman forts, plus a reconstructed section. Even in the sections where the wall is gone the defensive ditches are often intact, so you still feel like you're walking along a rampart. In September 2014 I hiked the trail back-to-front with my dad. We had a few days of glorious weather followed by several days of low cloud and mist. That just made it even easier though to imagine we were Roman soldiers patrolling the edge of civilisation! Watch out for barbarians...
